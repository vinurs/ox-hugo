This underscore should appear escaped in Markdown: \_

This underscore is in a verbatim block, so it should not be escaped:
`_`

These underscores also shouldn't be escaped as they are in emoji
codes: :raised_hands:, :white_check_mark:.

And these ones should be eventually removed and <span class="underline">underline</span> the text
(_Requires CSS to do so._) -- **Org syntax**.
